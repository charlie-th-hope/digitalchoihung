  "article": "Charlie TH Hope (formerly known as Charlie Tak Hei Kwong, Cantonese: 鄺德希) is an interdisciplinary digital artist and a registered teaching professional in both Hong Kong and Canada. He holds a BA Honours (1st), a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (Qualified Teacher Status), a Master of Arts (Distinction). His digital practice spans massive data, web, sound, film, literature, transmedia storytelling, autobiography, community, and education.\n\nWith an academic and professional journey that has taken him across Hong Kong, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, and The Netherlands, Kwong has developed a deep interest in issues related to cultural diversity and identity. His postgraduate practice-based research projects, such as The Spatial Index, The Message Index, and Myself Index, explore themes of migration, cultural identity, and cultural memory.\n\nThese projects laid the groundwork for his graduate project, Digital Choi Hung, which revisits the estate he grew up in, and marked for city redevelopment in late 2023. Charlie also develops the project as a means of reconciling his identity crisis as an adoptee.",
